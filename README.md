EARLY DETECTION OF DIABETES USING DATA MINING TECHNIQUES

## Dataset Source

The [Diabetes Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset) used was downloaded from Kaggle and is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

For Exploratory Data Analysis the diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv is used

## Data Preprocessing

The Data Preprocessing methods produced 4 csv that we used for Classification, Clustering, and Prediction Analysis this is under the Final_Data_Set Folder

## Clustering Analysis

K Clustering, Bisect K-means Clustering, K-means Clustering with Logistic Regression, Random Forest

## Classification Analysis

Adaptive Boosting and Gradient Boosting Analysis are done in the Classification Folder

## Prediction Analysis

Decision Tree and Logistic Regression are done in the Prediction Folder

## Random Forest Analysis

Random Forest analysis are done in the Random Forest Prediction Folder

## Things to note

- For the file 'Decision Tree(Prediction).ipynb' in the Prediction folder, the code first runs using the non-normalized dataset. To run the code using the normalized dataset, comment out the code under '# Non-normalised data' and uncomment the code under '# Normalised data'.
