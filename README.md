# IS424 - Data Mining and Business Analytics G1T6
EARLY DETECTION OF DIABETES USING DATA MINING TECHNIQUES 

## Dataset Source
The [Diabetes Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset) used was downloaded from Kaggle and is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). 

## Things to note
- For the file 'Decision Tree(Prediction).ipynb' in the Prediction folder, the code first runs using the non-normalized dataset. To run the code using the normalized dataset, comment out the code under '# Non-normalised data' and uncomment the code under '# Normalised data'.
